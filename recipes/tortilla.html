    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Eggs</li>
      <li>White onion</li>
      <li>Waxy potatoes</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Peel and rinse the potatoes. Be sure to choose a waxy variety, as they
        won't break down as much during the cooking process.
      </li>
      <li>Thinly slice them using a sharp knife or mandolin.</li>
      <li>
        Pat the sliced potatoes dry with paper towel to remove excess moisture.
        This will help them crisp when they're fried.
      </li>
      <li>Sprinkle the slices with salt to add flavor.</li>
      <li>
        Add the sliced potatoes to hot olive oil, making sure the potatoes are
        fully covered with oil. (Don't worry, you can reuse the oil a few times,
        so it won't go to waste.)
      </li>
      <li>
        Cook over a medium heat for 20 minutes, being careful not to let them
        brown too much.
      </li>
      <li>
        While the potatoes are cooking, beat the room-temperature eggs in a
        large bowl until well combined.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the salt. Many people taste the raw egg mixture to adjust the salt
        level, but if you prefer not to, add a couple of teaspoons for now.
      </li>
      <li>
        When the potatoes are fully cooked, some may start to break apart.
        That's okay, but don't let them become too broken down.
      </li>
      <li>
        Once the potatoes have cooked for 20 minutes, use a skimmer or spider to
        remove them from the hot oil.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place the cooked potatoes in a colander to allow them to cool and drain,
        about 5 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the sliced onions to a separate pan with a bit of olive oil. Cook
        over a medium heat until they start to caramelize, about 15-20 minutes.
        Add a splash of water if needed from time to time so that they don't
        burn.
      </li>
      <li>Gently stir the onions into the egg mixture.</li>
      <li>
        Carefully add the potatoes into the onion and egg mixture, stirring
        gently to keep them from scrambling the egg.
      </li>
      <li>
        Let the mixture sit for 15 minutes. I know it's tempting to just go
        ahead and make the tortilla, but trust me on this!
      </li>
      <li>
        Gently pour the tortilla batter into a frying pan over medium-low heat.
        You don't want the pan to be too hot. Gently cook the tortilla for about
        6-8 minutes on the first side. You can run a spatula occasionally along
        the sides to make sure it's not sticking.
      </li>
      <li>
        To flip the tortilla, grab a plate that's larger than the frying pan.
        (See my note below about the two tortilla trick to make this easier.)
        Put the plate on top of the pan and flip quickly and confidently. It
        will be runny, but don't worry -- you'll put everything back into the
        pan to cook the other side!
      </li>
      <li>
        Slide the tortilla back into the frying pan and let the other side cook
        for another six to eight minutes (let it cook longer if you like your
        tortilla fully cooked through). Then flip back out onto a clean plate.
        Allow it to cool for at least ten minutes before slicing and enjoying.
      </li>
    </ol>
